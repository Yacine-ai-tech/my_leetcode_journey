# LeetCode Problem 1: Two Sum
#
# Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
# You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
# You can return the answer in any order.
#
# Example:
# Input: nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
# Output: [0,1]
# Explanation: Because nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, we return [0, 1].
#
# Approach: Use a dictionary to store the complement of each number and its index.
# Time Complexity: O(n)
# Space Complexity: O(n)

class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: List[int], target: int) -> List[int]:
        num_map = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            if complement in num_map:
                return [num_map[complement], i]
            num_map[num] = i
        return []  # No solution found
