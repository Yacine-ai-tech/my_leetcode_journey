# My LeetCode Journey

Welcome to my comprehensive LeetCode solutions repository! This collection showcases my implementations of LeetCode problems across three programming languages: Java, Python, and C++. Each problem is solved in all three languages to demonstrate different approaches and coding paradigms, serving as both a learning resource and a portfolio of algorithmic problem-solving skills.

- `problems/`: Organized collection of LeetCode problems, each in its own folder named by problem number and title (e.g., `0001-two-sum`).

## Languages Used

- **Java**: Object-oriented solutions with clean, maintainable code following Java best practices.
- **Python**: Concise, readable implementations leveraging Python's expressive syntax.
- **C++**: High-performance solutions optimized for efficiency and memory usage.

## Code Quality Standards

- Comprehensive documentation with problem descriptions, examples, and approach explanations.
- Time and space complexity analysis for each solution.
- Consistent naming conventions and clean code principles.
- Solutions are thoroughly tested and optimized where possible.

## Purpose

This repository serves as:
- A personal archive of solved LeetCode problems
- A reference for different language implementations of the same algorithms
- A demonstration of coding proficiency across multiple paradigms
- A resource for learning and comparing programming language approaches
